# ARIMA-Modeling
- Worked on healthcare time series datasets of patients arrival rates at a clinic to aid the manager in planning sufficient resources based on arrival pattern
- Performed Dickey-Fuller test for stationarity on the seasonal data
- Found ACF  and PACF values to build auto-regression and moving average parts of the ARIMA model
- Carried out the Ljung-Box test and founds residuals to check the fit of the model
- Made use of the auto.arima function from Forecast package in R to get the best (p,d,q) setting based on the least AIC and MLE
